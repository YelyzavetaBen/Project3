<h1><a href="https://github.com/YelyzavetaBen/Project2/blob/main/Trial%20Stores.ipynb">Evaluation of Trial Store Performance and Strategic Recommendations for Chip Category Expansion</a></h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of trial store layouts and determine their effectiveness in boosting sales. This analysis will help the Category Manager for Chips to decide whether the new store layouts should be implemented across all stores
<br />

<h2>Description</h2>
The project involves a detailed analysis of sales data from trial and control stores. Using customer transaction data and store performance metrics, I will assess the impact of the trial layouts on sales, customer engagement, and purchasing behaviour. The analysis will focus on comparing trial stores with carefully selected control stores to ascertain the effectiveness of the new layouts. Insights gained from this study will guide strategic decisions regarding the roll-out of successful layouts across the retail network.
<br />

<h2>Skills</h2>
data cleaning and preprocessing, data analysis and visualization, statistical anlysis, control store selection, experimentation and uplift testing, hypothesis testing and formulation of actionable recommendations.
<br />

<h2>Technology</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Pandas</b>
- <b>Seaborn</b> 
- <b>Matplotlib</b>

<h2>Results</h2>
In the retail sector, strategic store layout plays a critical role in enhancing sales and customer experience. A recent analysis involving three trial stores (77, 86, and 88) compared against selected control stores (233, 155, and 237) highlighted the importance of layout optimization in a retail chain specializing in chips. The findings revealed that stores 77 and 88 experienced significant sales increases during the trial period, validating the effectiveness of the new layouts in these locations. In contrast, Store 86 showed no significant improvement, suggesting discrepancies in implementation or external influences
